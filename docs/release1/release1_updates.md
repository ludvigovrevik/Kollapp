# 🚀 Release 1 Updates

This is Release 1 of the **KollApp** project. In Release 1, we began with a basic to-do list application as a foundation, implementing simple functionality such as adding tasks with due dates and saving them in a text file. This initial step was part of our broader vision to evolve the project into a more comprehensive application.

## 🌟 Major Updates
### 🧑🏼‍💻 Set up

- Built the maven project up with pom and module info. 

### 📂 Data Persistence

- Text file storage in data persistence of tasks. 


### ✅ Task Management

- Add task to list and task will be saved in a txt file.

## 🧪 Testing and Code Quality

- Made Junit and UI tests for the classes.




## 🔮 Future Plans

In the next release, we plan to implement the following features:

### 🔐 Login Feature

- Introducing a login feature to allow users to create and manage their personal accounts.
- Enhancing security by incorporating authentication, which will restrict access to specific features based on user roles.

### 👥 Group Functionality

- Adding group functionality to enable users to create, join, and manage groups for collaborative projects.
- This feature will allow multiple users to share tasks, updates, and resources within a specific group, fostering teamwork and organized communication.

### 📂 JSON Data Persistence

- Implementing JSON data persistence to save and retrieve user data, tasks, and settings across sessions.
- By using JSON files for data storage, the application will maintain user information, task status, and other configurations, improving user experience through consistent data management.

### ✅ JaCoCo Integration

- Integrating JaCoCo (Java Code Coverage) to provide insights into code coverage for all test cases.
- This feature will help identify untested parts of the codebase, ensuring higher code reliability and supporting better quality assurance.

### 🧪 Mockito for Unit Testing

- Adding Mockito for unit testing to simulate complex interactions and dependencies within the code.
- This will enable more efficient testing of isolated components, making the codebase more robust and reliable by validating individual functionalities.

### 🐞 SpotBugs Static Analysis

- Including SpotBugs as a static code analysis tool to detect potential bugs and vulnerabilities in the code.
- This feature will help identify and resolve common issues early in the development process, improving code quality and reducing runtime errors.

### 📝 Checkstyle for Code Standards

- Incorporating Checkstyle to enforce coding standards and best practices across the project.
- This feature will ensure a consistent coding style, making the code more readable, maintainable, and aligned with industry standards.
