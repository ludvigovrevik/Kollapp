# ðŸ“Š Project Architecture Diagrams

## Class Diagram

We decided to create a class diagram for the core module of the **KollApp** project. This diagram provides a clear picture of the main classes and how they interact, giving a better understanding of the application's core structure. Here's a quick overview of the key components:

- **User**: Represents each person using the app, with details like their username, password, and the groups they belong to.
- **ToDoList**: Takes care of managing tasks, with methods to add and remove tasks.
- **Task**: Covers the details of each task, such as its name, due date, description, and priority level.
- **UserGroup**: Represents a group of users, including the groupâ€™s name and its list of members.

The diagram shows how these classes are connected and interact with each other, highlighting the relationships between users, to-do lists, tasks, and user groups within the core module.
