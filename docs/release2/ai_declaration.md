- **Review and Verification:** All content and code suggestions generated by ChatGPT were reviewed and validated by team members to ensure accuracy and relevance.
  
### 2. GitHub Copilot

**Description:**

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. It uses machine learning to suggest code completions, generate code snippets, and provide real-time coding assistance based on the context within the code editor.

**Integration and Access:**

- **Integration:** Implemented within Visual Studio Code via the GitHub Copilot extension.
- **Usage Period:** Actively used throughout the coding phases of the project.

**Usage in the Project:**

- **Automated Documentation:**
  - **Generating Javadocs:** Utilized to automatically generate Javadoc comments for classes and methods, enhancing the documentation of our codebase.
  - **Efficient Documentation:** Accelerated the documentation process by providing relevant descriptions and parameter explanations.

- **Code Completion and Suggestions:**
  - **Real-Time Assistance:** Offered context-aware code suggestions and completions, improving coding efficiency and reducing the likelihood of syntax errors.
  - **Boilerplate Code Generation:** Helped in writing repetitive code segments, allowing the team to focus on more complex programming tasks.

- **Code Quality Improvement:**
  - **Best Practices:** Suggested coding patterns and practices that improved the overall quality and readability of the code.
  - **Learning Aid:** Served as a learning tool by exposing team members to new functions and libraries relevant to the project.
