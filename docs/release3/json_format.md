# üìÇ JSON Save Format

The **KollApp** project uses JSON for data persistence, leveraging the Jackson library for JSON processing.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Persistence Structure

Under the persistence directory, we have the following folders for saving relevant information:

- `users`: Stores user login data.
- `groups`: Stores information about available groups.
- `todolists`: Stores the to-do lists for each user.
- `grouptodolists`: Stores the to-do lists for each group.

This structure ensures that all relevant information about the user, the user's to-do lists, and the available groups with their respective to-do lists are organized and easily accessible.

### üë§ User Login Data Format

Each user has their own JSON file that includes the following fields:

- **username**: The unique identifier for the user.
- **password**: The user's password for authentication.
- **userGroups**: A list of all the groups the user has access to.

Example for `kollapp/persistence/src/main/java/persistence/users/johnDoe.json`:

```json
{
  "username": "kristin",
  "password": "password123",
  "userGroups": ["Lerkendal studentby rom 33"]
}
```

### üìù User TodoList Data Format

Each user todo-list has its own JSON file that includes the following fields:

- **dateTime**: The date and time for the task, specified in the format [YYYY, MM, DD]
- **priority**: The priority level of the task.
- **completed**: A boolean indicating whether the task is completed.

Example for `kollapp/persistence/src/main/java/persistence/todolists/johnDoe.json`:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
